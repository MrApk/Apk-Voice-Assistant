# Apk assistant

This is a simple voice assistant that listens to user input through the microphone, sends the input to a chatbot API, and plays back the response using text-to-speech.

## Installation

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
   pip install speech_recognition pyttsx3 gtts pygame requests
```


## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Speak into the microphone to ask a question or give a command.
3. The voice assistant will process your input and respond accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with the speech recognition or text-to-speech features, make sure your microphone is properly connected and working.
- Check your internet connection if the voice assistant is unable to fetch responses from the chatbot API.
